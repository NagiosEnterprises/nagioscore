Here are all the changes since Nagios 2.x:

* Adaptive monitoring:
     - Check timeperiod can now be modified on-the-fly

* Notification changes:
     - Added first_notification_delay to host and object definitions to delay first notification
     - Notifications are now sent out when flap detection is disabled on a host/service-specific
       or program-wide basis ($NOTIFICATIONTYPE$ macro = "FLAPPINGDISABLED")
     - Notifications can now be sent out when scheduled downtime starts, ends, and is cancelled.  The
       $NOTIFICATIONTYPE$ macro will be set to "DOWNTIMESTART", "DOWNTIMEEND", or "DOWNTIMECANCELLED",
       respectively.  In order to receive downtime notifications, specify 's' or 'downtime' in contact, host,
       and/or service notification options.

* Object changes: 
     - Added ability to use multiple template names (separated by commas) in object definitions
     - Added ability to null out optional character directives in object definitions (using 'null' without quotes)
     - Added hostg/service/contactgroup_members directives to host/service/contactgroup definitions,
       respectively, for allowing including host, service, or contact members from "sub" groups.
     - Added support for custom variables in host, service, and contact definitions
     - Added host_notifications_enabled, service_notifications_enabled, can_submit_commands to contact definitions
     - Added optional display_name directive to host and service definitions
     - Removed serviceextinfo definitions and merged variables with service definitions
     - Removed hostextinfo definitions and merged variables with host definitions
     - Services inherit contactgroups, notification interval, and notification period from associated host if not specified
     - Service escalations inherit contactgroups, notification interval, and escalation period from associated service if not specified
     - Host escalations inherit contactgroups, notification interval, and escalation period from associated host if not specified
     - Host, service, host escalation, and service escalation definitions now support a 'contacts' directive, along with 'contact_groups'
     - Service dependencies with blank dependent host/hostgroup names will create "same host" dependencies


* Performance optimizations:
     - Added ability to precache object config files
     - Added ability to exclude object relationship and circular path
       checks from verification process

* Check output:
     - Multiline output support for host and service checks

     - Added $LONGHOSTOUTPUT$ and $LONGSERVICEOUTPUT$ macros
     - Added $TEMPPATH$ macro
     - Removed $COMMENTDATAFILE$ and $DOWNTIMEDATAFILE$ macros
     - Added $HOSTDISPLAYNAME$ and $SERVICEDISPLAYNAME$ macros
     - Custom host/service/contact macros accessible via $_HOST<varname>$, $_SERVICE<varname>, or $_CONTACT<varname>$.
       On-demand host/service macros for custom vars are working.  Custom vars are also set as environment vars.
     - On-demand service macros can contain and empty host name field.  In this case, the name of the current host will be used.
     - $HOSTNOTES$ and $SERVICENOTES$ macros may now contain macros themselves

* Flapping changes:
     - Added flap_detection_options directive to host and service definitions to control which
       states (i.e. OK, WARNING, UNKNOWN, and/or CRITICAL) are used in flap detection logic
     - Percent state change and state history are now retained and recorded even when host/service
       flap detection is disabled.
     - Hosts and services are immediately check for flapping when flap detection is enabled program-wide.
     - Hosts/services that are flapping when flap detection is disabled program-wide are now logged

* External command changes:
     - Added PROCESS_FILE external command to allow processing of external commands found in
       an external (regular) file.  Very useful for passive checks with long output or scripting.
     - Custom commands can now be submitted to Nagios.  Custom command names are prefixed with an underscore
       and are not processed internally by the Nagios daemon.  They may, however, be processed by NEB modules.
     - External commands are now checked by default.  Nagios 2.x and earlier did not check for external commands
       by default.

* Status data changes:
     - Contact status information is now saved (although it is not processed by the old CGIs)

* Retention data changes:
     - Contact status information is now retained across program restarts
     - Comment and downtime IDs are now stored across program restarts, should be unique unless reset

     - Scheduled host checks now help improve performance, instead of hinder it (if caching is enabled)
     - Added cached_host_check_horizon option for enabling use of cached host check results
     - Added enable_predictive_host_dependency_checks for enabling predictive checks of dependent hosts
     - Added retry_interval to host definitions
     - Added check_for_orphaned_hosts option and support for orphaned host checks
     - Passive host check states can now be translated from their original DOWN/UNREACHABLE state if the
       new translate_passive_host_results option is enabled

* Service check logic changes:
     - 'parallelize' option in service definitions deprecated/no longer used
     - Added cached_service_check_horizon option for enabling use of cached service check results
     - Added enable_predictive_service_dependency_checks for enabling predictive checks of dependent services

* Dependency changes:
     - Host and service dependencies can now have a timeperiod during which they're valid (dependency_period directive)

* Event broker changes:
     - Updated NEB API version
     - Modified adaptive program status callback
     - Added adaptive contact status callback
     - Added host/service precheck callbacks to allow modules to cancel/override internal host/service checks

* Embedded Perl changes:
     - Added 'enable_embedded_perl' option to main config file to control whether epn is enabled/disabled
     - Added support for perl plugins to specify whether or not they should be run under the epn...  The
       second to tenth line of a perl plugin may start with '# nagios: +epn' or '# nagios: -epn' to explicity indicate that it
       should be run under the epn.
     - Added 'use_embedded_perl_implicitly' option to main config file to determine whether or not perl
       plugins will use the epn if they don't explicitly allow/disalow it

     - Hostgroup and servicegroup summaries now show important/unimportant problem breakdowns like the TAC CGI
     - Minor layout changes to host and service detail views in extinfo CGI

* Misc changes:
     - More information given when testing scheduling (-s command line option)
     - Removed fixed length restrictions for host names and service descriptions
     - Plugin output length restriction bumped up to 4K
     - Added temp_path directive to main config file for specifying temp directory
     - Multiline output support for system commands via my_system()
     - Added global event_id and notification_id vars that are at least unique during a single run of Nagios

     - Renamed service_reaper_frequency to check_result_reaper_frequency
     - Fractional notification and check intervals are now supported (e.g. "3.5" minutes)
     - Backslash chars are now used to escape command arguments that contain \ or ! characters
     - Added 'external_command_buffer_slots' and 'check_result_buffer_slots' variables to specify size of internal buffers
