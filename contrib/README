Nagios Contrib README
#####################

This directory contains various programs, scripts, etc. that
have been contribed by various people.  Read the source code
if you want to find who did what.

Here is a description of what you'll find...


Conversion Programs:
--------------------

- convertcfg.c is a program to quickly convert old "host" config
  files to the new template-based object config files.  It can also
  convert extended host information definitions. Type 'make convertcfg'
  to compile the utility.


Additional CGIs:
----------------

- traceroute.cgi is (surprise) a CGI that allows you to do a traceroute
  to a specific IP address.  Simply do a 'chmod +x' to make it executeable
  and place it in the CGI directory (i.e. /usr/local/nagios/sbin).
  Requires Perl.

- daemonchk.c is a CGI contributed by Karl DeBisschop that can test to
  see whether or not the Nagios process is running.


Miscellaneous Goodies:
----------------------

- htaccess.sample is a *sample* .htaccess file that can be used with
  Apache to require password authentication for access to the web
  interface.

- Automated rpm making. 
  1. ./configure # to generate contrib/Makefile
  2. cd contrib ; make rpm
  3. *.rpm will be generated in contrib direcotry.
