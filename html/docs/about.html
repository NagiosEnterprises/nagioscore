<strong><u>What Is Nagios?</u></strong>

</p>



<p>

Nagios&reg; is a system and network monitoring application.  It watches hosts and services that you specify, alerting you when things go bad and when they get better.

</p>

<p>

Nagios was originally designed to run under <a href="http://www.linux.com">Linux</a>, although it should work under most other unices as well.

</p>

<p>

Some of the many features of Nagios include:

</p>

<ul>

<li>Monitoring of network services (SMTP, POP3, HTTP, NNTP, PING, etc.)

<li>Monitoring of host resources (processor load, disk usage, etc.)

<li>Simple plugin design that allows users to easily develop their own service checks

<li>Parallelized service checks

<li>Ability to define network host hierarchy using "parent" hosts, allowing detection of and distinction between hosts that are down and those that are unreachable

<li>Contact notifications when service or host problems occur and get resolved (via email, pager, or user-defined method) 

<li>Ability to define event handlers to be run during service or host events for proactive problem resolution

<li>Automatic log file rotation

<li>Support for implementing redundant monitoring hosts

<li>Optional web interface for viewing current network status, notification and problem history, log file, etc.

</ul>
