2002-10-23 23:19  kellan

	* magpie_simple.php, rss_cache.inc, rss_fetch.inc, rss_parse.inc:
	  MAJOR CLEANUP!

	  * rss_fetch got rid of the options array, replaced it with a more
	  PHP-like solution of using defines.  constants are setup, with
	  defaults, in the function init()

	  got rid of the idiom of passing back an array, its was awkward to
	  deal with in PHP, and unusual (and consquently confusing to
	  people).  now i return true/false values, and try to setup error
	  string where appropriate (rss_cache has the most complete example
	  of this)

	  change the logic for interacting with the cache

	  * rss_cache major re-working of how error are handled.  tried to
	  make the code more resillient.  the cache is now much more aware
	  of MAX_AGE, where before this was being driven out of rss_fetch
	  (which was silly)

	  * rss_parse properly handles xml parse errors.  used to sail
	  along blithely unaware.
