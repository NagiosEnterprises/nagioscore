#################################################################


# MAIN CONFIGURATION FILE
# This tells the CGIs where to find your main configuration file.
# The CGIs will read the main and host config files for any other
# data they might need.

main_config_file=@sysconfdir@/nagios.cfg



# PHYSICAL HTML PATH
# This is the path where the HTML files for Nagios reside.  This
# value is used to locate the logo images needed by the statusmap
# and statuswrl CGIs.

physical_html_path=@datadir@



# URL HTML PATH
# This is the path portion of the URL that corresponds to the
# physical location of the Nagios HTML files (as defined above).
# This value is used by the CGIs to locate the online documentation
# and graphics.  If you access the Nagios pages with an URL like
# http://www.myhost.com/nagios, this value should be '/nagios'
# (without the quotes).

url_html_path=@htmurl@



# CONTEXT-SENSITIVE HELP
# This option determines whether or not a context-sensitive
# help icon will be displayed for most of the CGIs.
# Values: 0 = disables context-sensitive help
#         1 = enables context-sensitive help

show_context_help=0



# PENDING STATES OPTION
# This option determines what states should be displayed in the web
# interface for hosts/services that have not yet been checked.
# Values: 0 = leave hosts/services that have not been check yet in their original state
#         1 = mark hosts/services that have not been checked yet as PENDING

use_pending_states=1



# AUTHENTICATION USAGE
# This option controls whether or not the CGIs will use any 
# authentication when displaying host and service information, as
# well as committing commands to Nagios for processing.  
#
# Read the HTML documentation to learn how the authorization works!
#
# NOTE: It is a really *bad* idea to disable authorization, unless
# you plan on removing the command CGI (cmd.cgi)!  Failure to do
# so will leave you wide open to kiddies messing with Nagios and
# possibly hitting you with a denial of service attack by filling up
# your drive by continuously writing to your command file!
#
# Setting this value to 0 will cause the CGIs to *not* use
# authentication (bad idea), while any other value will make them
# use the authentication functions (the default).

use_authentication=1



# x509 CERT AUTHENTICATION
# When enabled, this option allows you to use x509 cert (SSL)
# authentication in the CGIs.  This is an advanced option and should
# not be enabled unless you know what you're doing.

use_ssl_authentication=0



# DEFAULT USER
# Setting this variable will define a default user name that can
# access pages without authentication.  This allows people within a
# secure domain (i.e., behind a firewall) to see the current status
# without authenticating.  You may want to use this to avoid basic
# authentication if you are not using a secure server since basic
# authentication transmits passwords in the clear.
#
# Important:  Do not define a default username unless you are
# running a secure web server and are sure that everyone who has
# access to the CGIs has been authenticated in some manner!  If you
# define this variable, anyone who has not authenticated to the web
# server will inherit all rights you assign to this user!
 
#default_user_name=guest



# SYSTEM/PROCESS INFORMATION ACCESS
# This option is a comma-delimited list of all usernames that
# have access to viewing the Nagios process information as
# provided by the Extended Information CGI (extinfo.cgi).  By
# default, *no one* has access to this unless you choose to
# not use authorization.  You may use an asterisk (*) to
# authorize any user who has authenticated to the web server.

authorized_for_system_information=nagiosadmin



# CONFIGURATION INFORMATION ACCESS
# This option is a comma-delimited list of all usernames that
# can view ALL configuration information (hosts, commands, etc).
# By default, users can only view configuration information
# for the hosts and services they are contacts for. You may use
# an asterisk (*) to authorize any user who has authenticated
# to the web server.

authorized_for_configuration_information=nagiosadmin



# SYSTEM/PROCESS COMMAND ACCESS
# This option is a comma-delimited list of all usernames that
# can issue shutdown and restart commands to Nagios via the
# command CGI (cmd.cgi).  Users in this list can also change
# the program mode to active or standby. By default, *no one*
# has access to this unless you choose to not use authorization.
# You may use an asterisk (*) to authorize any user who has
# authenticated to the web server.

authorized_for_system_commands=nagiosadmin



# GLOBAL HOST/SERVICE VIEW ACCESS
# These two options are comma-delimited lists of all usernames that
# can view information for all hosts and services that are being
# monitored.  By default, users can only view information
# for hosts or services that they are contacts for (unless you
# you choose to not use authorization). You may use an asterisk (*)
# to authorize any user who has authenticated to the web server.

authorized_for_all_services=nagiosadmin
authorized_for_all_hosts=nagiosadmin



# GLOBAL HOST/SERVICE COMMAND ACCESS
# These two options are comma-delimited lists of all usernames that
# can issue host or service related commands via the command
# CGI (cmd.cgi) for all hosts and services that are being monitored. 
# By default, users can only issue commands for hosts or services 
# that they are contacts for (unless you you choose to not use 
# authorization).  You may use an asterisk (*) to authorize any
# user who has authenticated to the web server.

authorized_for_all_service_commands=nagiosadmin
authorized_for_all_host_commands=nagiosadmin



# READ-ONLY USERS
# A comma-delimited list of usernames that have read-only rights in
# the CGIs.  This will block any service or host commands normally shown
# on the extinfo CGI pages.  It will also block comments from being shown
# to read-only users.

#authorized_for_read_only=user1,user2



# STATUSMAP BACKGROUND IMAGE
# This option allows you to specify an image to be used as a 
# background in the statusmap CGI.  It is assumed that the image
# resides in the HTML images path (i.e. /usr/local/nagios/share/images).
# This path is automatically determined by appending "/images"
# to the path specified by the 'physical_html_path' directive.
# Note:  The image file may be in GIF, PNG, JPEG, or GD2 format.
# However, I recommend that you convert your image to GD2 format
# (uncompressed) but ONLY IF YOU WILL USE THE LEGACY MAP EXCLUSIVELY,
# as this will cause less CPU load when the CGI generates the image.

#statusmap_background_image=smbackground.gd2



# STATUSMAP TRANSPARENCY INDEX COLOR
# These options set the r,g,b values of the background color used the statusmap CGI,
# so normal browsers that can't show real png transparency set the desired color as
# a background color instead (to make it look pretty).  
# Defaults to white: (R,G,B) = (255,255,255).

#color_transparency_index_r=255
#color_transparency_index_g=255
#color_transparency_index_b=255



# DEFAULT STATUSMAP LAYOUT METHOD
# This option allows you to specify the default layout method
# the statusmap CGI should use for drawing hosts.  If you do
# not use this option, the default for the legacy map is to use
# user-defined coordinates and the default for the new map is "6"
# (Circular Balloon).
# Valid options for the legacy map are as follows:
#	0 = User-defined coordinates
#	1 = Depth layers
#	2 = Collapsed tree
#	3 = Balanced tree
#	4 = Circular
#	5 = Circular (Marked Up)
# Valid options for the new map are as follows:
#	0 = User-defined coordinates
#	1 = Depth Layers (Horizontal)
#	2 = Collapsed tree (Horizontal)
#	3 = Balanced tree (Horizontal)
#	4 = DON'T USE
#	5 = Circular Markup
#	6 = Circular Balloon
#	7 = Balanced tree (Vertical)
#	8 = Collapsed tree (Vertical)
#	9 = Depth Layers (Vertical)
#	10 = Force Map

#default_statusmap_layout=6



# DEFAULT STATUSWRL LAYOUT METHOD
# This option allows you to specify the default layout method
# the statuswrl (VRML) CGI should use for drawing hosts.  If you
# do not use this option, the default is to use user-defined
# coordinates.  Valid options are as follows:
#	0 = User-defined coordinates
#       2 = Collapsed tree
#       3 = Balanced tree
#       4 = Circular

default_statuswrl_layout=4



# STATUSWRL INCLUDE
# This option allows you to include your own objects in the 
# generated VRML world.  It is assumed that the file
# resides in the HTML path (i.e. /usr/local/nagios/share).

#statuswrl_include=myworld.wrl



# PING SYNTAX
# This option determines what syntax should be used when
# attempting to ping a host from the WAP interface (using
# the statuswml CGI.  You must include the full path to
# the ping binary, along with all required options.  The
# $HOSTADDRESS$ macro is substituted with the address of
# the host before the command is executed.
# Please note that the syntax for the ping binary is
# notorious for being different on virtually ever *NIX
# OS and distribution, so you may have to tweak this to
# work on your system.

ping_syntax=/bin/ping -n -U -c 5 $HOSTADDRESS$



# REFRESH RATE
# This option allows you to specify the refresh rate in seconds
# of various CGIs (status, statusmap, extinfo, and outages).  

refresh_rate=90



# DEFAULT PAGE LIMIT
# This option allows you to specify the default number of results 
# displayed on the status.cgi.  This number can be adjusted from
# within the UI after the initial page load. Setting this to 0
# will show all results.  

result_limit=100



# ESCAPE HTML TAGS
# This option determines whether HTML tags in host and service
# status output is escaped in the web interface.  If enabled,
# your plugin output will not be able to contain clickable links.

escape_html_tags=1



# SOUND OPTIONS
# These options allow you to specify an optional audio file
# that should be played in your browser window when there are
# problems on the network.  The audio files are used only in
# the status CGI.  Only the sound for the most critical problem
# will be played.  Order of importance (higher to lower) is as
# follows: unreachable hosts, down hosts, critical services,
# warning services, and unknown services. If there are no
# visible problems, the sound file optionally specified by
# 'normal_sound' variable will be played.
#
#
# <varname>=<sound_file>
#
# Note: All audio files must be placed in the /media subdirectory
# under the HTML path (i.e. /usr/local/nagios/share/media/).

#host_unreachable_sound=hostdown.wav
#host_down_sound=hostdown.wav
#service_critical_sound=critical.wav
#service_warning_sound=warning.wav
#service_unknown_sound=warning.wav
#normal_sound=noproblem.wav



# URL TARGET FRAMES
# These options determine the target frames in which notes and 
# action URLs will open.

action_url_target=_blank
notes_url_target=_blank



# LOCK AUTHOR NAMES OPTION
# This option determines whether users can change the author name 
# when submitting comments, scheduling downtime.  If disabled, the 
# author names will be locked into their contact name, as defined in Nagios.
# Values: 0 = allow editing author names
#         1 = lock author names (disallow editing)

lock_author_names=1



# SPLUNK INTEGRATION OPTIONS
# These options allow you to enable integration with Splunk
# in the web interface.  If enabled, you'll be presented with
# "Splunk It" links in various places in the CGIs (log file,
# alert history, host/service detail, etc).  Useful if you're
# trying to research why a particular problem occurred.
# For more information on Splunk, visit http://www.splunk.com/

# This option determines whether the Splunk integration is enabled
# Values: 0 = disable Splunk integration
#         1 = enable Splunk integration

#enable_splunk_integration=1

# This option should be the URL used to access your instance of Splunk
#splunk_url=http://127.0.0.1:8000/



# NAVIGATION BAR SEARCH OPTIONS
# The following options allow to configure the navbar search. Default
# is to search for hostnames. With enabled navbar_search_for_addresses,
# the navbar search queries IP addresses as well. It's also possible
# to enable search for aliases by setting navbar_search_for_aliases=1.

navbar_search_for_addresses=1
navbar_search_for_aliases=1



# DEFAULTS FOR CHECKBOXES FOR ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
# Enabling ack_no_sticky will default the "Sticky Acknowledgement" to 
# be unchecked.
# Enabling ack_no_send will default the "Send Notification" to 
# be unchecked.

#ack_no_sticky=0
#ack_no_send=0



# SHOW ONLY HARD STATES IS TACTICAL OVERVIEW
# This option controls whether only HARD states are counted on the
# Tactical Overview, or if both HARD and SOFT states are counted.
# Set to 1 to show only HARD states. Defaults to 0 (HARD+SOFT).

#tac_cgi_hard_only=0
